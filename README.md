# Memory-Game
Welcome to the exciting world of the Memory Game! This classic and addictive game will test your memory skills and keep you entertained for hours. The objective is simple: you must uncover pairs of matching cards by flipping them over and remembering their positions.

At the beginning of each round, a set of cards will be placed face-down on the game board. Each card features a small word or picture, making it visually engaging. Your task is to flip over two cards at a time, trying to find a match. If the two cards you flip over have the same word or picture, they remain face-up, and you earn points. However, if the cards don't match, they are flipped face-down again, and you must try to remember their locations for future turns.

The challenge lies in remembering the positions of the cards as you continue flipping and uncovering new ones. The game ends when all the cards have been matched and removed from the board. Your final score is based on the number of matches you successfully made.

To enhance the experience, the Memory Game offers different difficulty levels, allowing you to test your skills at various levels of complexity. You can start with a small number of cards and gradually increase the difficulty by adding more cards to the board.

This game is not only enjoyable but also great for improving cognitive skills such as concentration, visual memory, and attention to detail. It's suitable for players of all ages and can be played alone or with friends and family to see who can achieve the highest score.

Get ready to exercise your brain and have a blast with the Memory Game! Can you remember where all the matches are hidden? Give it a try and see how well you can challenge your memory prowess!
